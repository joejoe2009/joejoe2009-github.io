    <p>The Aba Nigeria Temple is the 121st operating temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. An announcement was made on April 2, 2000, that a temple would be built in Aba, in the state of Abia, to serve the nation's 68,000 Latter-day Saints. This was the third temple to be built in Africa.</p>
    <h2>Blessings of The temple</h2>
    <div class="news">
    <p>A temple differs from other houses of worship. Unlike chapels, the temple is closed on the Sabbath so that people can attend church and be with their families on that hallowed day. Temples are open for sacred work on other days of the week.</p>

    <p>A temple is literally the house of the Lord, reserved for ordinances of eternal significance. Those ordinances include baptisms, marriages, endowments, and sealings.</p>

    <p>Each temple is symbolic of our faith in God and an evidence of our faith in life after death. The temple is the object of every activity, every lesson, every progressive step in the Church. All of our efforts in proclaiming the gospel, perfecting the Saints, and redeeming the dead lead to the holy temple</p>

    <p>President Hinckley declared that “these unique and wonderful buildings, and the ordinances administered therein, represent the ultimate in our worship. These ordinances become the most profound expressions of our theology.”1 Ordinances of the temple are absolutely crucial. We cannot return to God’s glory without them.</p>
