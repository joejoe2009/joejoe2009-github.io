    <p>Here in the temple we have activities that are sacred, That when we participate in this activity, will draw us closer to our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. In the temple we are taught important truths, participate in priesthood ordinances (sacred ceremonies), and make covenants (sacred promises) with God that prepare us to return to His presence. </p>
    <h3>Temple attending activities are: </h3>
    <p>* Baptism and Confirmation for Our Ancestors</p>
    <p>* Endowment</p>
    <p>* Sealings</p>
